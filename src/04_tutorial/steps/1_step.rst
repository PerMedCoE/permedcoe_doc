The first step to create a building block is to generate a template to start
with. The template can be created with the following ``permedcoe`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    permedcoe template building_block my_building_block

The result of this command is a folder named ``my_building_block`` containing
a python package with all scripts and base code to start developing your
Building Block.

.. IMPORTANT::

    The Building Block name in this example is ``my_building_block``, but
    should be defined for your Building Block with a specific name (e.g.
    tool used inside the Building Block or functionality).

    This tutorial will continue using ``my_building_block``, so take it into
    account if you define a different name and swap ``my_building_block`` with
    yours.
