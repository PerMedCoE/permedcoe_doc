Application
===========

Application template creation
-----------------------------

The first suggested step is to start with a template created with the
``permedcoe`` command:

.. code-block:: console

  permedcoe template application my_application

The result of this command is a folder containing a three folders, one
for the three supported workflows managers (PyCOMPSs, Nextflow and Snakemake),
where a template for each of them is provided.

.. HINT::

    The application template creation provides the main actions to be
    performed in order to complete your building block:

    .. code-block:: console

        ------------------------------------------
        To be completed:

        - app.py:(9):	    TODO: Import the desired building blocks and use invoke or any other function.
        - Snakefile:(0):	TODO: Declare the building blocks to be used as rules.
        - Snakefile:(9):	TODO: Change bb to the building block name.
        - NextFlow.nf:(7):	TODO: Declare the building blocks to be used as process.
        - NextFlow.nf:(18):	TODO: Change bb to the building block name.
        ------------------------------------------

.. NOTE::

    The template provides support for PyCOMPSs, Nextflow and Snakemake, but it is not
    mandatory to implement the application for all of them. However, this decision
    will tight your application to a single workflow manager that needs to be available
    where the execution is going to take place.


Folder structure
----------------

The application contains the following scripts:

.. code-block:: console

    .
    ├── NextFlow
    │   ├── launch.sh
    │   └── NextFlow.nf
    ├── PyCOMPSs
    │   ├── app.py
    │   ├── launch.sh
    │   ├── launch_without_pycompss.sh
    └── SnakeMake
        ├── launch.sh
        └── Snakefile

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| PyCOMPSs                            | Folder containing the PyCOMPSs application template  |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| PyCOMPSs/app.py                     | Application template for PyCOMPSs                    |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| PyCOMPSs/launch.sh                  | Launch with PyCOMPSs script                          |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| PyCOMPSs/launch_without_pycompss.sh | Launch without PyCOMPSs script                       |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| SnakeMake                           | Folder containing the Snakemake application template |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| SnakeMake/launch.sh                 | Launch with Snakemake script                         |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| SnakeMake/Snakefile                 | Application template for Snakemake                   |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| NextFlow                            | Folder containing the Nextflow application template  |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| NextFlow/launch.sh                  | Launch with Nextflow script                          |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| NextFlow/NextFlow.nf                | Application template for Nextflow                    |
+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

The developer responsibility is to complete at least one of the following files:

- ``NextFlow.nf``
- ``app.py``
- ``Snakefile``

And the mainly expected content of the application is the usage of building blocks.

.. TIP::

  Due to the Python nature of PyCOMPSs applications, it can also support python code and objects
  among building blocks, enabling the implementation of complex workflows with inner parallelism.


Execution
---------

The execution of the application depends on the workflow manager choosen. Consequently,
the execution will be performed following the worklflow manager instructions.

For example, the execution with PyCOMPSs locally is be performed with the ``runcompss``
command (see
`runcompss documentation <https://pycompss.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Sections/03_Execution_Environments/01_Master_worker/01_Local/01_Executing.html#runcompss-command>`_ for
more details), whilst for supercomputers is performed with the ``enqueue_compss`` command (see
`enqueue_compss documentation <https://pycompss.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Sections/03_Execution_Environments/01_Master_worker/02_Supercomputers/01_Executing.html#compss-job-submission>`_ for
more details).


Best practices
--------------

There are a set of best practices suggested to application developers:

- Use a code style if using PyCOMPSs:
    - `pep8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
    - `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_

- Document your Application.
